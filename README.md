# API-project

Portfolio Project

You will be building a working API and front-end. This is part 2 of 2.
Continuing in your API project repo, in a branch called part-two-answer, you will be creating the API back-end to go along with your front-end you've already built.
Your back-end should have at least the following routes 
GET to retrieve all records
GET to retrieve a particular record
POST for creating a new record
Your back-end should be supported by a test suite with tests for each controller, store data in a database, and utilize migrations for database management
Be sure to make sure your front-end documentation matches your back-end implementation
Your first progress check with your instructor will be the week of 5/26/2021
You should push all progress to GitHub prior to your meeting with the instructor
Your graded submission for this part will be due on 6/22/2021 before class
